    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Why students mental health matters</h1>
    <body style="font-family: Arial; background-color: #257d1d;"></body>
    <p>Mental health plays a crucial role in students lives as it supports their learning, academic success, relationships, and overall well-being. When mental health is poor it can cause difficulties with focus, lower grades, weaker social interactions, and a higher chance of substance abuse. On the other hand, strong mental health fosters concentration, motivation, resilience, and the ability to build positive relationships that carry into adulthood.
